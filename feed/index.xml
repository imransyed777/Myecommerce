										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Once the clothes have been designed and manufactured, they need to be sold. But how are clothes to get from the manufacturer to the customer? The business of buying clothes from manufacturers and selling them to customers is known as retail. Retailers make initial purchases for resale three to six months before the customer is able to buy the clothes in-store.</p>



<p>Fashion <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/marketing">marketing</a> is the process of managing the flow of merchandise from the initial selection of designs to be produced to the presentation of products to retail customers, with the goal of maximizing a company’s sales and profitability. Successful fashion marketing depends on understanding consumer desire and responding with appropriate products. Marketers use sales tracking data, attention to media coverage, focus groups, and other means of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ascertaining">ascertaining</a> consumer preferences to provide feedback to designers and manufacturers about the type and quantity of goods to be produced. Marketers are thus responsible for identifying and defining a fashion producer’s target customers and for responding to the preferences of those customers.</p>

<p>History of fast fashion</p>
<cite>fashion</cite></blockquote>



<p>The fast fashion model emerged in the 1970s when retailers began exporting production to countries, particularly in Asia, where they could pay workers lower wages than in Western countries. It took hold in the 1990s as companies accelerated output to keep up with trends. Previously, new clothing collections could be expected four times a year, but with fast fashion consumers can now expect new lines of clothing much more frequently, some brands generating 36 collections a year.</p>

<p>Fast fashion has significant environmental impacts both during and after production. The fashion industry as a whole is responsible for 10 percent of carbon emissions, uses large quantities of water, and employs dyes and chemicals that pollute the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment">environment</a>. It also produces a lot of textile waste. Fast fashion in particular, with its low prices and poor-quality items, encourages consumers to discard an item of clothing even if it has been worn only a few times. The clothing ends up in landfills around the world, including in the so-called “clothing graveyard” in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Atacama-Desert">Atacama Desert</a>, Chile. Moreover, fast fashion companies primarily use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/synthetic">synthetic</a>&nbsp;fibers, such as polyester, nylon, and acrylic. All of these materials are inexpensive to produce, but they are derived from fossil fuels. Hence, items made from these materials are not biodegradable and will remain in landfills for centuries.</p>
